        <h1>FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPER | CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE </h1>
    <h3>Hello! I'm Shully </h3>
    <p>A passionate <b>Full Stack Developer</b> and <b>Customer Service Representative</b> who loves crafting scalable, modern and
    user-friendly web applications.<br>I specialize in turning complex problems into 
elegant digital solutions. </p><br>
    
<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Tech Girl Shully, a creative problem-solver and full-stack web developer with a strong focus on clean 
        code, seamless user experience and continous learning. <br>I work with technologies like <strong>React, 
            Node.js, Javascript, Express, MongoDB </strong>and<strong> Python </strong>to bring ideas to life. <br> I believe
            in writing code that's not just functional but also beautiful. When I'm not coding, you'll find me 
            exploring new frameworks or mentoring upcoming developers. <br>
            Before diving into Tech, I spent several years as a <b>Customer Service Representative</b>, where I developed
            exceptional communication, problem solving and interpersonal skills. <br>
            These experiences taught me the importance of understanding user needs- a perspertive that now guides my approach
            to building intuitive and user-centered web applications. Whether I'm coding a responsive interface or managing 
            a project, I aim to deliver seamless experiences that truly serve people.
